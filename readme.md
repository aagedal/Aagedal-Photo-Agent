# Aagedal Photo Agent
![SCR-20260127-rhdx](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31cc3e86-ce9d-4deb-add9-3ca62fd426b9)

An open source alternative to Camerabits PhotoMechanic or Adobe Bridge for writing IPTC-compatible metadata. Runs on macOS 15+ with on Apple Silicon.

This includes variables and metadata presets, star rating and color labels.

The plan is also to include folder specific face recognition so that the user only needs to write the name of a person once to tag all images of that person.

This app is currently in a pre-beta state.




## Installation
```bash
brew install aagedal/casks/aagedal-photo-agent
```
