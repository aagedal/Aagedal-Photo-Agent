# TODO

## Priority
[] Improve face recognition. Change backend?
[] Add reverse Geocoding: Use GPS metadata to add name of country and city. Add a variable for these. (The DD GPS coordinates seems to work in Apple Maps, maybe also MapKit?)
[] Add keyboard shortcuts: Process variable, process all variables in folder, write all pending metadata in folder.



## Nice to have
[] Improve performance when selecting with mouse or using shift select in the thumbnail grid view.
[] Reduce time for hover help text
[] Create a warning that writing Metadata with the app will break C2PA validation.
[] Make the additional fields visible without having to click to open the section.
[] Move Creator next to Copyright
[] Make it possible to use variables in Keywords (Use case: I want my initials and todays date to be part of a single keyword)
[] Make it possible to sync and export presets. JSON in iCloud?
[] Add reverse sorting order button-toggle next to the sort mode drop down
[] Add an option to write metadata automatically when changing focus from the metadata field or moving to the next image
