# TODO

## Priority
1. Fix performance when selecting with mouse or using shift select in the thumbnail grid view.
2. Make sure that comma (,) and semicolon (;) can never be a part of a Keyword or Person. Pressing these keys should always trigger separation, but never be part of the item iteself. This must also be correct when applying names using the Face Group feature.
3. Copy and paste with keyboard shortcuts doesn't seem to work in the metadata fields, this is very annoying

## Future plans - after priority issues are fixed
- Improve face recognition. Change backend?

## Nice to have
- Create a warning that writing Metadata with the app will break C2PA validation.
- Make the additional fields visible without having to click to open the section.
- Move Creator next to Copyright
- Make it possible to use variables in Keywords (Use case: I want my initials and todays date to be part of a single keyword)
- Make it possible to sync and export presets. JSON in iCloud?
- Add reverse sorting order button-toggle next to the sort mode drop down
- Add an option to write metadata automatically when changing focus from the metadata field or moving to the next image
